# CIS-254 Database Setup for Windows

___

Welcome to the SQL Server and Oracle Database Container Setup repository for Rock Valley College's CIS-254 Database Programming Class!

This repository provides a pre-configured setup tailored specifically for students of CIS-254 to quickly and reliably set up Developer Edition of the SQL Server and Oracle XE Database containers on Windows using Docker.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, make sure you:

- Access to Docker Desktop: Install and run Docker Desktop on your Windows machine and setup an account on docker.com to ensure access to pull images from Docker Hub.
- Basic PowerShell Knowledge: Ability to Run a PowerShell Command Window as Administrator and execute simple commands.
- Basic Docker Knowledge: Familiarity with Docker commands and concepts will be helpful but is not required.

## What You'll Find in This Repository

- docker-compose.yml: Defines services for SQL Server and Oracle Database containers.
- .env: A sample environment file to customize configuration values, such as database credentials and ports.

Letâ€™s get started and get our database containers created! ðŸš€

## Getting started

- Open Docker Desktop.  Ensure that you have logged in using your Docker account to ensure that you can connect to Docker Hub to pull any needed images.
- Open a PowerShell Window as Administrator.
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory using the "cd", change directory command.
- Execute the "docker-compose up -d" command.
- View the created containers under the "Containers" option in Docker Desktop.
- In PowerShell, execute the command "docker container ls" to show some brief information for the containers.  Locate the Container ID for the SQL Server Container.

- Change the Owner on the sqlserver directory within the container using the following PowerShell command where your_container_id is the Container ID that is shown in the screen shot above:

    ```
      docker exec -it -u root your_container_id /bin/bash -c 'chown -R mssql /var/opt/sqlserver'
    ```

- Change the Group on the sqlserver directory within the container using the following PowerShell command where your_container_id is the Container ID that is shown in the screen shot above:

    ```
      docker exec -it -u root your_container_id /bin/bash -c 'chgrp -R mssql /var/opt/sqlserver'
    ```

## Testing Database Connections From Container

- Go to the Containers tab in Docker Desktop.  
- Expand the docker-db-windows-setup to show the Oracle and SQL Server containers if they are not already visible.  
- Test the SQL Server Connection
  - Locate the sqlserver_db container.
  - Left click on the three vertical dots to expose a menu of options.  
  - Click on the "Open in Terminal" menu option.
  - Type the following in the terminal window:
  
    ```
    /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -U SA -P Testing@112233 -No    
    ```

  - This should start a database session.  Type the following at the > prompts:

    ```
    1> SELECT @@VERSION
    2> GO
    ```

  - The database should display it's version as the result of the above query:

    ```

- Test the Oracle Connection
  - Locate the oracle_db container.
  - Left click on the three vertical dots to expose a menu of options.  
  - Click on the "Open in Terminal" menu option.
  - Type the following in the terminal window:
  
    ```
    sqlplus sys as sysdba    
    ```

  - This should return a prompt asking for the password.  Enter "admin" as the password:

    ```
    SQL*Plus: Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production on Tue Dec 31 05:16:07 2024

    Enter password:
    ```

  - After the password is entered, the connection should be established and the database version is displayed:

    ```
    Connected to:
    Oracle Database 21c Express Edition Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production
    Version 21.3.0.0.0
    ```
